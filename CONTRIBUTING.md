To contribute to jqsh, please open issues and/or pull requests.

~~The approval process is as follows:~~

*   ~~Pull requests sent by a core member must be approved by another core member.~~
*   ~~Pull requests sent by anyone else must be approved by 2 core members.~~

(Since there is currently only one core member, the above is temporarily ineffective. I guess I'll just review all the issues/PRs myself and hope for contributors to eventually show up.)

The core member is:

*   [@fenhl](https://github.com/fenhl)

This list is subject to change if and when the project starts to attract additional regular contributors.
