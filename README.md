**jqsh** is a shell with a scripting language based on [jq](http://stedolan.github.io/jq/) and [sh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bourne_shell).

With a [prototype](https://github.com/jq-shell/python-jqsh) having been written in Python, this project aims to become the full implementation of the shell in [Rust](http://www.rust-lang.org/). You can run it using `cargo run` (`cargo` comes with Rust). To exit the loop, press control-D.

This is version 0.0.1 of jqsh ([semver](http://semver.org/)).
